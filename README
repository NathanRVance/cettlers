Cettlers

This game is based on the board game Settlers of Catan, a Klaus Teuber game. The user intface is entirely in ascii characters.
Cettlers was written because linux has a lack of command line strategy games; Cettlers is intended to be the first in a line of popular board games for the linux/mac command line.

To install,
$ cd /directory/with/*.c/files/
$ make
$ cp settlers /directory/in/your/path/

To run simply execute settlers
$ settlers

Or, if you refuse to copy the executable into your path, run
./settlers
while in the directory containing settlers.
